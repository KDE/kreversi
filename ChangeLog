	Backport of fix for bug 89829: KReversi: When you save a game, the
	color for Human and Computer is not saved
	* board.cpp (Board::saveGame): Save m_humanColor as HumanColor.  
	* (Board::loadGame): Fix loading of m_humanColor.
	* Remove(!) saving of the side to move since this is implicit
	anyway.
	* (Board::loadgame): Fix emit of signal turn, and the condition to
	call computerMakeMove().

0.6.5	Support for non GNUC++ compilers.
	
0.6.4	fixed that get-hit-and-then-doubleclick bug

	fixed a bug that caused the computer to switch sides if no
	computer move is possible instead of getting another human move

0.6.3	sound fix: when the animation is finished, the correct piece gets
	redrawn before doing a sound-sync (how could I ever believe 0.6.2
	would be the last change :-)

0.6.2   animation fixed (hope this will be the last change)

0.6.1   fixed that newly introduced highscore bug
	computer continues now if a game was saved while thinking

0.6:	better integration into new FSSTND
	fixes for new kdecore
	layout management for all dialogs
	mini-icon and icon
	locale-strings changed - partial translation required for
	other languages than english and german
	removed both the kfixedtopwidget and ktablistbox
	drawing a border around the reversi board
	session-management - what an overkill for kreversi :-))
	you can save (and load) exactly ONE game

	tried to remove absolute widget placing/sizing
	removed the date field from the HOF

0.2.1: times(NULL) does not work with FreeBSD (fixed)
       fixed a bug (reported by Stephan Kulow) where pixmaps of pieces
       are not initialized properly (could't reproduce the bug with
       my system)
       New "About" dialog showing all (well, most) of the contributors
       All xpm's have now 8 bits per color component instead of 16.
       16 bits seems to confuse the XPM loader of Qt.       

0.2:   better pieces
       animations
       fixed a small bug: when someone made it in the hall of fame,
       he was'nt notified of this
