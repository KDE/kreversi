	* DESIGN: New document

	----------------- CVS commit on stuff below --------------------
	
	Simplify saving of the game
	* Game.{h,cpp} (move(uint)): New method.
	* kreversi.cpp (saveGame): Use the new method, and don't call
	loadGame to restore the Game object.

2004-09-29  Inge Wallin  <inge@lysator.liu.se>

	Continue to make KReversi a proper model/view program:
	Step I.1 of the plan (see TODO): Fix the class Game
	* Game.h (Game): Convert to store moves instead of positions.
	* Game.cpp (Game): Code cleanup and convert as above.
	* Game.{h,cpp}: Follow naming conventions from the rest of the
	program.
	* Position.{h,cpp}: Follow naming conventions from the rest of the
	program.
	* Position.{h,cpp} (Position::operator=): new method.
	(Position::makeMove): new method.

	Added myself in the credits in the about window.
	(Will add myself to the real authors when we have KGame and
	network play ready. :-) )
	
2004-09-27  Inge Wallin  <inge@lysator.liu.se>

	Continue to make KReversi a proper model/view program:
	* Transfer ownership of Game and Engine to kreversi from Board.
	board.h, board.cpp, kreversi.h, kreversi.cpp: lots of changes.

	* SuperEngine.h (interrupt): renamed to interrupted()

2004-09-26  Inge Wallin  <inge@lysator.liu.se>

	Fix bug 90195: KReversi: Changing the skill level late in a game
	doesn't count as cheating:
	* board.h (Board::m_lowestStrength): new member
	* board.cpp (Board::newGame): set m_lowestStrength
	* board.cpp (Board::setStrength): update m_lowestStrength and
	update highscore type.

	Fix Bug 90190: KReversi: Switch sides and then Undo gets the
	program out of sync.
	* board.cpp (doUndo): If it is the computers turn to move after an
	undo, call computerMakeMove().
	(doUndo): Fix repainting so that it looks nice.

2004-09-25  Inge Wallin  <inge@lysator.liu.se>

	Transfer the rest of the slots for KActions to kreversi.cpp

2004-09-24  Inge Wallin  <inge@lysator.liu.se>

	Start the work to port KReversi to KGame/Kplayer:

	* Board::undo() -> KReversi::slotUndo()
	(Board::doUndo()): Do the real work of undoing.
	* Board->hint() -> KReversi::slotHint()
	(Board::showHint): do the actual work of showing the hint.

	Rename some slots for clarity

	* Board::score(Color)
	* Board::interrupted()
	* Board::strength()

2004-09-23 Anne-Marie Mahfouf <annemarie.mahfouf@free.fr>

	Cleaned some previously left lines of code in board.cpp

2004-09-22  Inge Wallin  <inge@lysator.liu.se>

	Fix bug 89829: "KReversi: When you save a game, the color for
	Human and Computer is not saved" again.  See the discussion on the
	KDE bugzilla for details
	(http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=89829).
	* board.cpp (Board::saveGame): Save m_humanColor as HumanColor.  
	* Remove saving of the side to move since this is implicit
	anyway.
	* (Board::loadGame): Fix loading of m_humanColor and
	m_competitiveGame
	* Fix emit of signal turn, and the condition to call
	computerMakeMove().
	* prefs_addons.h: Removed

	indentation

2004-06-29 (1.5) Nicolas Hadacek <hadacek@kde.org>
	* use KZoomMainWindow

2004-05-29 (1.4) Nicolas Hadacek <hadacek@kde.org>

1.0
	* I finally decided that it´s stable enough. This is the final
	version (if no further bugs are detected and I do not have a
	good idea what to improve)

	* ChangeLog reversed
	
0.6.6
    * [Robert Williams]  Changed Reversi.kdelnk to kreversi.kdelnk
    * [Robert Williams]  Add -caption "%c" to kreversi.kdelnk
    * [Robert Williams]  Added kapp->getCaption()
    * [Robert Williams]  getHelpMenu(true, 0) -> Uses own About dialog

0.6.5	Support for non GNUC++ compilers.
	
0.6.4	fixed that get-hit-and-then-doubleclick bug

	fixed a bug that caused the computer to switch sides if no
	computer move is possible instead of getting another human move

0.6.3	sound fix: when the animation is finished, the correct piece gets
	redrawn before doing a sound-sync (how could I ever believe 0.6.2
	would be the last change :-)

0.6.2   animation fixed (hope this will be the last change)

0.6.1   fixed that newly introduced highscore bug
	computer continues now if a game was saved while thinking

0.6:	better integration into new FSSTND
	fixes for new kdecore
	layout management for all dialogs
	mini-icon and icon
	locale-strings changed - partial translation required for
	other languages than english and german
	removed both the kfixedtopwidget and ktablistbox
	drawing a border around the reversi board
	session-management - what an overkill for kreversi :-))
	you can save (and load) exactly ONE game


0.5: added klocale to support translation
	added german translation
	fixed a few bugs
	tried to remove absolute widget placing/sizing
	removed the date field from the HOF
	grayscale support
	fixed those CPU busy bug

	fixed segfaulting on exit

0.4: interims release - no changelog

0.3: Sound support (using libmediatool)
     When switching sides, the Quit -> the computer made on move. FIXED
     Fixed a few typos

0.2.1: times(NULL) does not work with FreeBSD (fixed)
       fixed a bug (reported by Stephan Kulow) where pixmaps of pieces
       are not initialized properly (could't reproduce the bug with
       my system)
       New "About" dialog showing all (well, most) of the contributors
       All xpm's have now 8 bits per color component instead of 16.
       16 bits seems to confuse the XPM loader of Qt.       

0.2:   better pieces
       animations
       fixed a small bug: when someone made it in the hall of fame,
       he was'nt notified of this
       some improvements in the Hall Of Fame
