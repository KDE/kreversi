	* fixed a bug (trap). I´m not sure when I commited this faulty
	stuff, but it must have been a while ago

1999-02-01 Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* fixed a warning (egcs)

1.0
	* I finally decided that it´s stable enough. This is the final
	version (if no further bugs are detected and I do not have a
	good idea what to improve)

	* ChangeLog reversed
	
0.6.6
    * [Robert Williams]  Changed Reversi.kdelnk to kreversi.kdelnk
    * [Robert Williams]  Add -caption "%c" to kreversi.kdelnk
    * [Robert Williams]  Added kapp->getCaption()
    * [Robert Williams]  getHelpMenu(true, 0) -> Uses own About dialog

0.6.5	Support for non GNUC++ compilers.
	
0.6.4	fixed that get-hit-and-then-doubleclick bug

	fixed a bug that caused the computer to switch sides if no
	computer move is possible instead of getting another human move

0.6.3	sound fix: when the animation is finished, the correct piece gets
	redrawn before doing a sound-sync (how could I ever believe 0.6.2
	would be the last change :-)

0.6.2   animation fixed (hope this will be the last change)

0.6.1   fixed that newly introduced highscore bug
	computer continues now if a game was saved while thinking

0.6:	better integration into new FSSTND
	fixes for new kdecore
	layout managment for all dialogs
	mini-icon and icon
	locale-strings changed - partial translation required for
	other languages than english and german
	removed both the kfixedtopwidget and ktablistbox
	drawing a border around the reversi board
	session-managment - what an overkill for kreversi :-))
	you can save (and load) exactly ONE game


0.5: added klocale to support translation
	added german translation
	fixed a few bugs
	tried to remove absolute widget placing/sizing
	removed the date field from the HOF
	grayscale support
	fixed those CPU busy bug
	removed the -finline-functions optimize flag (not portable)
	ported to new KDE file system standards (well, mostly)
	fixed segfaulting on exit

0.4: interims release - no changelog

0.3: Sound support (using libmediatool)
     When switching sides, the Quit -> the computer made on move. FIXED
     Fixed a few typos
     Cursor changes when thinking
	
0.2.1: times(NULL) does not work with FreeBSD (fixed)
       fixed a bug (reported by Stephan Kulow) where pixmaps of pieces
       are not initialized properly (could't reproduce the bug with
       my system)
       New "About" dialog showing all (well, most) of the contributors
       All xpm's have now 8 bits per color component instead of 16.
       16 bits seems to confuse the XPM loader of Qt.       

0.2:   better pieces
       animations
       fixed a small bug: when someone made it in the hall of fame,
       he was'nt notified of this
       some improvements in the Hall Of Fame

0.1.2: background color selectable via dialog
       background pixmaps implemented, selectable via menu
       background pixmaps are scaled to fit size
       pieces are drawn at runtime instead of pixmaps
       some accelerators added
       toolbar buttons for help and hint added

0.1.1: now pixmaps are installed
       a kdelnk file is installed
       version numbering changed
