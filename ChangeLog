2004-05-29 (1.4) Nicolas Hadacek <hadacek@kde.org>

1.0
	* I finally decided that it´s stable enough. This is the final
	version (if no further bugs are detected and I do not have a
	good idea what to improve)

	* ChangeLog reversed
	
0.6.6
    * [Robert Williams]  Changed Reversi.kdelnk to kreversi.kdelnk
    * [Robert Williams]  Add -caption "%c" to kreversi.kdelnk

    * [Robert Williams]  getHelpMenu(true, 0) -> Uses own About dialog

0.6.5	Support for non GNUC++ compilers.
	
0.6.4	fixed that get-hit-and-then-doubleclick bug

	fixed a bug that caused the computer to switch sides if no
	computer move is possible instead of getting another human move

0.6.3	sound fix: when the animation is finished, the correct piece gets
	redrawn before doing a sound-sync (how could I ever believe 0.6.2
	would be the last change :-)

0.6.2   animation fixed (hope this will be the last change)

0.6.1   fixed that newly introduced highscore bug
	computer continues now if a game was saved while thinking

0.6:	better integration into new FSSTND
	fixes for new kdecore
	layout management for all dialogs
	mini-icon and icon
	locale-strings changed - partial translation required for
	other languages than english and german
	removed both the kfixedtopwidget and ktablistbox
	drawing a border around the reversi board
	session-management - what an overkill for kreversi :-))
	you can save (and load) exactly ONE game

       my system)
       New "About" dialog showing all (well, most) of the contributors
       All xpm's have now 8 bits per color component instead of 16.
       16 bits seems to confuse the XPM loader of Qt.       

0.2:   better pieces
       animations

       he was'nt notified of this
