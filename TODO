Old TODO items, partially done/not done
=======================================

* undo/redo
	undo works, but I'll probably do not make a redo function

* Sound support:
  I'm not happy with
  the sound files I have so if
  you have better sounds, mail them to me 
  (uuencoded). I need sounds for the following actions:
	- game won
	- game lost
	- game drawn
	- turning a piece
	- putting a piece
	- something for the hall of fame (trumpets???)
