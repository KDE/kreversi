TODO-list for KREVERSI
======================
* network-play against human
* implement ULONG64 as a class instead of using gcc "long long int"


PARTIALLY DONE/NOT DONE
=======================
* undo/redo
	undo works, but I'll probably do not make a redo function

* Sound support:
  I'm not happy with
  the sound files I havem so if
  you have better sounds, mail them to me 
  (uuencoded). I need sounds for the following actions:
	- game won
	- game lost
	- game drawn
	- turning a piece
	- putting a piece
	- something for the hall of fame (trumpets???)
